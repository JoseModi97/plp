					There is one story in particularly that I'd like to leave you with today - a story I told when I had
					the great honor of speaking on Dr. And finally they come to this elderly black man who's been
					sitting there quietly the entire time.
					They imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren't rich, because in a
					generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential. More to do for the young woman
					in East St. For instance, in the United States, rules on charitable giving have made it harder for
					Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation.
					The man I met more than twenty years ago is a man who helped introduce me to my Christian faith, a
					man who spoke to me about our obligations to love one another; to care for the sick and lift up the
					poor. When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more
					resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on
					9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in
					our sights. And you know what - it's worked before. It's been about you. America will align our
					policies with those who pursue peace, and say in public what we say in private to Israelis and
					Palestinians and Arabs.
